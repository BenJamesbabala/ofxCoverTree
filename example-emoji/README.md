This example consists of image-space k-nearest-neighbour search over 6480 emoji. Each emoji is unrolled into a feature vector of `4096` dimensions (32 * 32 * 4).

Each row is one row of search results, with the leftmost emoji being the search query.

Press `up` and `down` to change the number of neighbours searched for, and `b` to switch between brute-force and cover-tree search.
